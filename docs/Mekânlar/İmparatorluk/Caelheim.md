"A Forgotten Border Watchtower"  
  
The ascent to Caelheim Keep is arduous, the steep and weathered stone steps cut into the mountainside long ago now worn smooth by time and exposure. The path zigzags up the rocky cliffs, devoid of vegetation, save for the occasional stubborn patch of lichen clinging to the stone. At the summit, the terrain levels out into a narrow plateau—an artificial clearing carved into the mountainside itself.  
  
At the center of this space, enclosed by an old but still-standing stone wall, lies the courtyard, a rectangular open space roughly 100 meters in length and 30 meters in width. The once-solid flagstones beneath your feet are cracked and uneven, and the walls surrounding it bear the marks of centuries of wind and rain. Despite its age, the structure is stable, its dark grey stone walls standing resolute against time.  
  
The main keep looms at the far end of the courtyard, built directly against the base of the mountain. It is a squat, two-story structure—nearly a perfect square, measuring about 20 meters on each side. The building is stark and utilitarian, its exterior bare of ornamentation or decorative flourishes. Where once there were windows, now only hollow frames remain, empty voids staring out over the courtyard like the eye sockets of a long-dead sentinel. The doors have long since rotted away, leaving the entrance open to the elements. Inside, the walls are thick and cold to the touch, the interior space divided into abandoned quarters, a common hall, and remnants of a functional barracks. The air carries the scent of old dust and dry stone.  
  
To the left of the keep, half-built into the sheer rock face, stands the watchtower—a tall, narrow structure that leans slightly into the mountain. Half of its bulk is carved directly into the stone, while the other half is constructed from the same dark grey blocks as the rest of the keep. A tight, spiraling staircase winds up its interior, its steps rough and uneven from centuries of use. At the top, an open-air platform offers a commanding view of the surrounding mountain passes, though whatever garrison once stood watch here has long since vanished.  
  
The surrounding mountains loom over the keep, jagged and barren, the wind howling through their craggy peaks. Below, the remnants of an old road—barely more than a faded trail—snake down toward the distant valley. Once, this fortress was a crucial outpost for the Empire, guarding the narrow passes between its lands and those of its neighbors. Now, it is a forgotten relic, abandoned for over a hundred years, left to the mercy of time and the elements.  
  
And yet, within its crumbling walls, something of value remains. Hidden beneath dust and decay, the fortress still holds one last secret—a functioning teleportation circle, its runes barely visible beneath layers of grime. A final legacy of the mage who once tended this place, it offers a rare and invaluable resource for those who would reclaim Caelheim Keep.  
  
The castle is ruined, but not broken. Forgotten, but not lost. And now, it has new owners.
