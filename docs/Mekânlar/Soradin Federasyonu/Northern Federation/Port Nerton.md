Northern Federation’s gate through the civilized world, Port Nerton is basically ruled by two families, Waterys and Manorburns. Watery Inn has a misleading name since the building is rather a complex with streets of its own. Built by the Admiral of the Pirate Navy, Lord Watery, the building is still expanding and housing every form shop imaginable inside. Most of the chapters of Federation guilds and companies are situated in this complex. Manorburns control the outskirts and residential parts of the city. Their trade network reaches even to the furthest part of the Nerton and they simply own the monopoly on the export goods.  
  
The city of Port Nerton is not walled since they do not expect any threat from the land. The port however, founded in the middle of a U-shaped bay, is fortified on the edges of the bay. Unique geography of the port allows nearly no winds making it harder for both approaching and leaving ships to move. The sun hardly shines on the city and the weather is often rainy if not cloudy.
