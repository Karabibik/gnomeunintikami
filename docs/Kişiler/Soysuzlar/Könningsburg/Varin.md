	Varin—known publicly as Old Smoke and privately as Three-Coin—is a well-regarded merchant and a quietly feared crime lord who operates in the Southdocks and Stonewarf districts of Könningsburg. To the public, he is the owner of Varin & Sons Shipping, a respected import–export house that deals in wine, spice, and other “specialty goods.” The irony of the name is deliberate—Varin has no sons, no heirs, and no family beyond those who serve him. The title gives him the illusion of lineage, a sense of permanence, and hides the fact that his real business is built on contraband, influence, and control.  
	  
	Though his reach is modest, his precision and intelligence have allowed him to survive where others vanish. Neither the local watch nor the imperial tax officers have ever managed to make anything stick to his name, and the higher offices quietly tolerate his presence. His operations keep order in the lower wharves—he is the man who keeps chaos contained.
