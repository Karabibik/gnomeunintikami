	Varin & Sons Shipping  
	Silver works as a “respectable” spiritual consultant and very real money launderer for Varin, a.k.a. Old Smoke, a quiet crime lord who runs the Southdocks. Her twin brothers, Tobias and Einzig, serve as Varin’s muscle and unofficially as Silver’s personal retaliation squad, anyone who threatens her tends not to walk straight for a while. Silver cleans coin through fake druid rituals, sells gossip from her clients as discreet intelligence, and occasionally joins Varin’s tighter operations. She’s not family on paper, but in the books and in the streets, she’s part of Varin’s inner circle.  
	  
	The Traum Circle  
	Silver goes to the Traum Circle like a believer and an admiring pupil. She lets herself sink into the cushions, follows his voice down into that warm, spinning dark, and feels old hurts stir… but behind her closed eyes she’s also watching how one man’s charm can turn pain into loyalty, he’s proof of how far raw Charisma can go if you treat the human mind like a temple you plan to quietly take over.  
	  
	The Emerald Veil  
	Silver is a member on paper, using the Veil’s rules as a shield when clients try to bargain, and its gatherings as an endless buffet of gossip and unofficial gay best friends.  
	  
	The Gilded Ladle Society  
	Silver slipped in thanks to one royal chef on her client list and never left; officially she’s there to “learn more about Könningsburg cuisine,” but in truth she’s there for the wine and the weaponized gossip. Over shared recipes for schnitzel, sauces and seasonal menus, the Gilded Ladle swaps stories about who is dining where, with whom, and at whose expense, information Silver quietly files away for later use in both her readings.  
	  
	The Aurora Mirror Club  
	Silver didn’t force her way in; someone simply noticed that she was pretty enough, well put-together, and could keep a table entertained. Now she’s on the guest list as a familiar face. Drinking, people-watching, making small talk that sounds harmless and isn’t. For her, the Aurora Mirror is part bar, part runway, and part quiet information stream.  
	  
	Mistress Sisters  
	Silver doesn’t enter as Silver Silvane but under a softer alias, posing as a part-time “companion” who does energy readings on the side.   
	She doesn’t come in as Silver Silvane, but as Elsa, hair darker, dress simpler, voice softer. She first slipped into the circle after breaking down in front of one of the Sisters, telling a shaky story about “private readings” in a rich man’s townhouse that ended with his temper and his hands both getting too heavy. The story was mostly fiction, but the pattern was real enough; the girl believed her, brought her in, and nobody in the Mistress Sisters Club asks too many questions. For her, the Mistress Sisters are the single richest source of information in the city: pillow talk turned into intel. She listens, nods, pulls a few cards, and walks away with names, habits, routes and weaknesses.
