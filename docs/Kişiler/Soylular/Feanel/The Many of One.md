# The Many of One Feanel  
  
!!! note inline end "Karakter Notları"  
	Matriarch of the Clan Feanel. She is a cryptic figure, seemingly no different from her brethren but rumored to be a holder of ancient secrets and immense power. It is unknown if she has a more 'real name.' Since she probably never ventured outside the Great Forest, knowledge about this important figure is very scarce.
