	Lareth Feanel, a diplomat with a serene and tranquil presence, is defined by his auburn and green hair worn long and loosely, evoking the image of moss on a tree. His clean green eyes carry a hint of mischief and a profound connection to the natural world. Adorned in earth-toned garments made from lightweight, natural materials, his attire reflects his clan's deep reverence for nature.  
	  
	Given his people's minimal concern for events beyond the Great Forest, Lareth spends the majority of his time in his room, engaging in meditation or conversing with plants and animals. A secluded figure even among wood elves, he generally only interacts with Orion or Elara in Forgunntal. While he may appear aloof and uninvolved to an outsider, Lareth's true value becomes evident during important events or when nature is threatened. In such moments, other elven clans know they can rely on Lareth and his clan.
