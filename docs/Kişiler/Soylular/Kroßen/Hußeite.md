!!! note "Karakter Notları"  
	Robe of the Hagi, Mask of the Hajje, Wand of the Haci şeklinde üç eşyası var. Adlar, eşyaları karıştırmamak için bu şekilde verilmiş. İşe yaramayınca biraz ağlıyor. Kral tanrının hizmetkârı olduğu söyleniyor.  
	  
	Born into the esteemed Empire's loyal Sorcerer family of Kroßen, Hußeite—also known as ßeit to friends—was blessed with two extraordinary gifts: a natural talent for Arcane magic and considerable wealth. Upon his father's demise, ßeit inherited the arcane powers of his bloodline. Swiftly mastering the illusion school of magic and the craft of magical item creation, he gained rapid acceptance into the illustrious Sun Assembly.  
	  
	Despite his potential for higher ranks and titles due to his exceptional talents, Haci chose to prioritize his personal pursuits, often causing him to be viewed as an oddity by the Sun Assembly. He devoutly served the Martyr God Harsus while remaining steadfastly loyal to the Empire.  
	  
	Some speculate that Haci's unparalleled talent in illusion has left him perceiving mysteries in every situation, leading to his reputation as a weird man. Initially, his eccentricities were tolerated, thanks to his jovial nature. However, after the loss of his wife, even his humor ceased.  
	  
	Following the loss of his wife, he wholly devoted himself to his faith. His quest to uncover the essence of Harsus led him on extensive travels across the land, visiting numerous locations rumored to house a fragment of the dead god. These travels earned him the moniker "Haci." It was during these journeys that he encountered his steadfast companion, Süden.  
	  
	Haci's appearance is striking; his mismatched eyes—blue and green—make him unforgettable after even the briefest encounter. His innate charisma, combined with his unique fashion sense, renders him a sight to behold. Donning a maroon robe of his own design, intricately embroidered with a star map visible even in daylight, he fastens the cape with the "Harsus's Crown" buckle, matching the robe's color. Concealing his face behind a white porcelain mask, only his neck and eyes are visible. To cast his spells, he wields a small wand resembling a flagellant's whip.
