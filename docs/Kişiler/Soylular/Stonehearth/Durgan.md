	Durgan Stoneheart is an old dwarf of venerable stature, his form towering above most of his kin—a testament to his unwavering resolve and towering presence within the world of arcane scholarship. His long, illustrious beard flows down his chest, a symbol of his age and wisdom. His eyes, weathered yet sharp, gleam with the accumulated knowledge and experiences gathered over centuries of study and exploration.  
	  
	As the Dean of the renowned Forguntall Academy, Durgan commands immense respect among wizards and scholars alike. His expertise lies in the art of conjuration, a discipline in which he has achieved mastery through years of dedicated practice. Only a select few can rival his profound understanding of summoning and bending the fabric of reality.  
	  
	Beyond his expertise in conjuration, Durgan possesses closely-guarded knowledge of the ancient and enigmatic art of creating golems. This arcane secret has been passed down through generations, and Durgan is one of the last remaining keepers of this nearly lost knowledge. The golems he has crafted in the past stand as magnificent and powerful artifacts of a forgotten era.  
	  
	Despite his immense knowledge and accomplishments, Durgan remains remarkably humble. He is often found mingling with students, encouraging their academic pursuits and offering guidance with a warm and compassionate heart.  
	  
	Durgan's attire reflects his preference for modesty and practicality over extravagance. He wears simple yet well-tailored robes in earthy tones—deep browns and slate grays—crafted from high-quality fabric. His outfit bears no ostentatious embellishments, emphasizing his focus on work rather than drawing attention to himself.  
	  
	A sturdy leather belt, adorned with small, unobtrusive dwarven engravings, clasps his robes together. This belt holds his spell components and a small pouch for personal belongings, a symbol of his heritage worn with understated pride.  
	  
	His accessories are minimal but meaningful. He wears a simple, finely crafted silver amulet, devoid of gemstones or extravagance, signifying his family's traditions without being showy.  
	  
	For practicality during magical experiments and conjuration rituals, Durgan dons fingerless gloves made from tough leather. These gloves, like his other attire, bear no markings or embellishments, underscoring his unassuming demeanor.  
	  
	His sturdy, well-worn boots, made of durable leather without excessive decoration, mirror his practicality. They are designed for long walks and exploration, enabling him to traverse both the Academy's marble halls and the rugged mountains surrounding it.  
	  
	In the hallowed halls of the Academy, Durgan's presence commands reverence. When he speaks, the room falls silent, and all ears are attuned to his words of wisdom. Many young wizards find themselves awestruck by the tales of his adventures and discoveries in the pursuit of magical knowledge.  
	  
	His office, adorned with ancient tomes and mysterious artifacts, serves as a testament to a lifetime dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of the arcane. One can often find him poring over ancient texts and conducting experiments, seeking to unlock new possibilities in the realm of magic.  
	  
	As the Dean of the Wizardry Academy, Durgan Stoneheart is a living legend, a repository of arcane knowledge, and a guiding beacon for all those who aspire to walk the path of the wizard.
