	Orion Ekrana, an ambassador with an aura of mystery, possesses black hair that falls just below his shoulders. His piercing green eyes seem to hold the wisdom of the ancient forest. Orion's lean and athletic build reflects his woodland upbringing, and he favors attire that seamlessly merges with nature, often adorned with intricate leaf motifs.  
	  
	Most of his time is spent in the forests near Forgunntal, sometimes disappearing for weeks. He particularly enjoys the cold days outside, as his home forest never experiences winter. When in the city, Orion gravitates towards other wood elves. Though not a prolific talker, his scanning gaze and sharp ears meticulously gather every bit of information in any room he enters.
