	Lyra Celebryl, an experienced diplomat, is also an extremely powerful wizard with regal poise and an air of sophistication. Her porcelain-like skin, pale and flawless, serves as a captivating contrast to her freely flowing raven-black hair. The piercing blue eyes she possesses reflect both wisdom and a hint of distant longing.  
	  
	In formal events, Lyra moves with grace, donning elegant attire that typically consists of flowing robes in vibrant hues, marking her as a figure of authority and influence. However, in her daily life, she opts for practical clothes such as pants and vests.  
	  
	Having lived a very long life, Lyra has accumulated vast knowledge and experience. Her extended lifespan has granted her exceptional combat prowess, showcasing skills in both close combat and the intricate arts of arcane warfare. Known for her unwavering composure, Lyra is notoriously difficult to surprise or impress. Her calm and calculated approach to situations makes her a formidable force in both diplomatic negotiations and on the battlefield. In dire circumstances, she is known to emit an aura of intimidation, as if something darker momentarily takes over her generally calming persona.
