!!! note "Karakter Notları"  
	Yaşı Delador'a yakın ve ona karşı durabilen nadir kişilerden. Mageocracy'nin mevcut idarecisi. Rünik büyüler ve özellikle büyülü dövmeler konusundaki çalışmalarıyla biliniyor.  
	  
	Elowen Thaylis, an enigmatic luminary within the mageocracy of the Federation of Soradin, embodies an ethereal elegance draped in regal crimson robes that gracefully billow around her. Her appearance is striking—a cascade of dark blue hair akin to a starry night, skin resembling the calm serenity of a sky's hue, and teal eyes that gleam with an intelligence that hints at the depths of her magical prowess. In moments of excitement or fury, her eyes ignite with a pulsating teal energy, a visual manifestation of her inner power.  
	  
	Born into the esteemed Thaylis clan of high elves, Elowen's roots trace back to a legacy of arcane brilliance. Her parents, skilled elven mages who fled the Empire's genocide against elves, established the first wizardry school in Soradin, entrusted by the budding nation to counter the Empire's formidable legion of wizards. Raised amidst this wellspring of wizardly knowledge, Elowen's potential surged. A prodigious talent, she surpassed her parents and surpassed all who journeyed to Soradin in a mere few centuries. As her reputation ascended, she rightfully assumed leadership in the newly formed Mageocracy, governing a small enclave of wizardly elite for nearly four centuries, answering only to the Lord of Soradin.  
	  
	Her tireless pursuit of magical innovation spans an array of disciplines. Among her many pioneering creations, the art of magical tattoos stands as a testament to her ingenuity. While she bestowed numerous figures in Soradin with these enchanted markings, her most awe-inspiring design adorns her own skin—an intricate network of pulsating teal tattoos, a mirror of the energy that dances in her eyes. These ethereal patterns act as conduits for her power, amplifying her magic and occasionally lending a subtle augmentation to her physical strength in moments of urgency.  
	  
	Beyond her personal endeavors, Elowen serves as a visionary proponent for the fusion of magic and technology. Her deep collaboration with Soradin's engineers and inventors propels the boundaries of progress. From steering the infancy of artillery concepts to aiding in the birth of proto-railroads, she has elevated Soradin's technological advancements with her magical expertise for centuries.  
	  
	Her existence has been entwined in a lifelong rivalry with Delador Erawan, the imposing force ruling the Sun Assembly of neighboring Empire. Elowen's pursuit of magical prowess and innovation has continually lagged behind Delador's formidable power. Yet, she navigates this rivalry with a unique approach, striving to outmaneuver him by introducing groundbreaking innovations within her realm. Though unable to birth an organization rivaling the Sun Assembly under Delador's rule, she has adeptly countered many of their moves. Her vigilance remains unyielding, anticipating Delador's calculated steps while forging her own path of advancement—a testament to her resilience and unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of magical achievement within Soradin.
