	Virel Erawan, a diplomat with a scholarly air, presents himself with meticulous style. His jet-black hair is impeccably coiffed, and his sharp amber eyes exude an intensity that hints at his profound understanding of arcane knowledge. Possessing a tall and slender frame, Virel carries an aura of intellectual curiosity; a mere glance at his countenance reveals his perpetual quest for new knowledge. His choice of attire often includes finely embroidered wizard robes, a reflection of his clan's dedicated pursuit of magical expertise.  
	  
	Among all the elven representatives in Forgunntal, Virel stands out as the one who ventures beyond the city limits the most. His inability to stay away from his laboratory in the Great Forest suggests an unwavering dedication to his research. Despite being an outgoing character, he remains reticent about his magical prowess and research endeavors, consistently redirecting conversations when the topics arise. Nevertheless, although he doesn't formally teach at Forgunntal University, he is recognized for occasionally assisting in their academic pursuits.
