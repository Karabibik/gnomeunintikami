	A sprawling network of abandoned fire giant mines deep within a volcanic mountain. The tunnels are unnaturally warm and dry, lined with charred stones and eerie remnants of the giants’ presence—massive tools, broken armor, and glowing runes that flicker faintly in the dark. Pools of acidic liquid, created by Nyrrathar’s bile, dot the labyrinthine corridors, and mutated creatures prowl the deeper tunnels under his control.  
	  
	Nyrrathar’s egg was stolen from a swamp by dragon hunters who sought to sell it as a rare prize. However, their venture ended in disaster when they were killed by a volcanic eruption. Left abandoned in the fire giant mines, the egg miraculously survived and hatched, leaving the young dragon to adapt to his strange surroundings. Despite the harsh conditions for a black dragon, Nyrrathar sensed a lingering ancient power within the ruins—an enigmatic force tied to the giants’ sudden disappearance.  
	  
	Nyrrathar has become obsessed with this mysterious presence, believing it to be a key to unlocking immense power. Though he dislikes the dry, warm air, he remains in the tunnels, fiercely guarding their secrets and working to unravel the mysteries of his lair. He tries to keep his lair unknown, because he is afraid it might be taken by him by an older dragon.  
	  
	Nyrrathar is cunning and curious but also deeply paranoid, fearing that others might uncover his lair’s secrets. He is unusually intellectual for his age, driven by an insatiable desire to understand the power hidden within the mines. However, this curiosity is tempered by his black dragon instincts, and he remains cruel and manipulative, delighting in tormenting those who stumble upon his territory.
