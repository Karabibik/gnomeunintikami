| **Karakter Betimi** | Adult<br><br>A robust and imposing figure, Thalryx’s muscular frame is larger and more resilient than most dragons of his age. His sapphire-blue scales are edged with streaks of silver that catch the light of his storms, making him appear as though he’s forged from the tempest itself. His claws and horns are jagged and worn, evidence of his preference for physical confrontations. |

!!! note "Karakter Notları"  
	Thalryx resides atop the highest peaks of a jagged mountain range, shrouded in perpetual thunderclouds. The entrance to his lair is a narrow, windswept ledge carved into the mountainside, guarded by natural lightning rods that draw storms to the area. Few who approach survive the treacherous ascent, and none who enter return to tell the tale. What lies within remains a mystery.  
	  
	Thalryx epitomizes discipline and order. His militaristic mindset and calm demeanor set him apart from the prideful impulsiveness of many dragons. Every decision he makes is calculated, every action methodical. He values efficiency and control, approaching combat and territory management with the precision of a seasoned commander.  
	  
	Despite his physical dominance, Thalryx is no fool. He is acutely aware of the existence of more powerful beings and avoids unnecessary risks. This caution is not born of fear but of pragmatism; he fights only when the odds are in his favor and never allows hubris to cloud his judgment.  
	  
	Thalryx relishes close combat, where he can leverage his immense strength and resilience to dominate his foes. His breath weapon is devastating, but he uses it sparingly, preferring the visceral satisfaction of claw and fang. His disciplined nature and methodical approach to combat make him a terrifying opponent, especially in the confined spaces of mountain passes.  
	  
	The mountain peaks and the stormy skies above them are Thalryx’s domain, and he defends them with ruthless efficiency. He views intrusions—be they by mortals or rival dragons—as direct challenges to his authority. Other dragons in the region are swiftly eliminated, their corpses left as warnings to others who might dare encroach on his territory.  
	  
	Thalryx demands tribute from nearby settlements, not just in wealth but in service and order. He despises chaos and views disobedience as a personal affront, punishing it with brutal precision. While he tolerates no rivals, he holds a grudging respect for those who demonstrate strength or discipline, even if they oppose him.
