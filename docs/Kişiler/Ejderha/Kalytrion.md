	High in the craggy peaks of a mountain range, Kalytrion’s lair is a series of interconnected caverns filled with natural, storm-absorbing crystals. These crystals hum with static energy and occasionally discharge bolts of lightning, making the caverns perilous for intruders. The storm energy amplifies Kalytrion’s own powers, giving him an edge in combat. His lair is accessible only through narrow paths prone to rockslides or via treacherous aerial routes.  
	  
	Kalytrion is intelligent, calculating, and disciplined, with a cruel streak befitting his chromatic nature. He sees the natural storms of his mountain domain as tools to control the surrounding valleys and villages. Kalytrion demands tributes of wealth and resources from those living below, punishing defiance by unleashing destructive lightning strikes or using his storms to destroy crops and homes.  
	  
	Kalytrion prides himself on his precision, never wasting effort or resources. He keeps meticulous records of his tributes and grudges, planning his actions like a tactician. Though young, his sharp mind and mastery of his domain have earned him fear and respect.
