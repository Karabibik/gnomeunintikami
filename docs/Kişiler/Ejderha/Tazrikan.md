	A treacherous network of flooded caverns carved into a glacier-touched mountainside. The runoff from the glacier forms icy pools, corrupted by Tazrikan’s acidic bile into lethal traps. Slick, moss-covered stones and twisting paths make the lair almost impossible to navigate. The air is damp and carries the stench of decay, while faint echoes of dripping water mask the dragon’s movements.  
	  
	Once the ruler of a vast swamp, Tazrikan was driven from his homeland by a rival dragon. Humiliated and seething with vengeance, he sought refuge in the mountains, far from the swampy terrain he once dominated. There, he discovered a magical spring deep within the caverns that enhanced his acidic breath and strengthened his powers. Tazrikan has claimed the spring as his own, using its corrupting waters to transform his lair into a deadly fortress.  
	  
	Tazrikan is bitter, cruel, and deeply vengeful. His exile has left him with a twisted sense of pride and an insatiable hunger to reclaim his former glory. He is a cunning tactician, using the terrain and natural hazards of his lair to wear down intruders before delivering the killing blow. He relishes the suffering of his enemies and often plays with his prey, allowing them to believe they have escaped before striking from the shadows.
