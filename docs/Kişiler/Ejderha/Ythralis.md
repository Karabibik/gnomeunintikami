	A massive bramble-covered hill, with thorny vines enchanted to grow at will and ensnare intruders. The hill conceals a vast underground cavern where Ythralis keeps his hoard.  
	  
	Ythralis is a tyrant who rules over the creatures of his forest with an iron claw. Unlike many green dragons, he thrives on direct confrontation, using his enchanted vines to trap foes and his venomous breath to finish them off. He views the forest as his kingdom and tolerates no trespassers, often enslaving humanoids who wander too close. Despite his brutality, he possesses a sharp intellect and occasionally makes deals with outsiders who show proper deference.  
	  
	He lives in a foresty patch of the high mountains, far away from the great forest and other green dragons. Yet he dreams of the day that he will conquer and rule a large portion of the great forest.
