	Lair: A storm-wracked peak in the southern mountains, laced with twisting paths and magical traps. The lair is littered with treasures won from wagers and games of chance.  
	  
	Personality: Kaelrion is a cunning strategist, favoring subtle manipulation over brute force. His illusions are so intricate that they can drive victims to paranoia or lead entire armies astray. Though he enjoys studying magic, his true passion lies in games of strategy and gambling. He frequently wagers against storm giants, other dragons, and bold adventurers, viewing such games as both entertainment and opportunities to assert his intellect. Kaelrion is charming when not directly threatened, making him an enigmatic figure in the dragon hierarchy.
