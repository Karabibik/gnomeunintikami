	Lair: Once a majestic frozen cavern adorned with ice sculptures and treasures, now lost to Auranthra the Storm Dragon. Ithalyss has no fixed lair and roams the world.  
	  
	Personality: Ithalyss is a shadow of his former self. Once a ferocious predator, he now limps across the frozen north, bearing the scars of his catastrophic defeat. His maimed front legs have left him slow and cumbersome, yet his rage is as fierce as ever. This wounded pride drives him to lash out at weaker creatures with uncontrollable fury. Despite his physical limitations, his icy breath is still devastating. Ithalyss avoids encounters with stronger dragons, consumed by both fear and hatred. His name strikes pity rather than fear, a fate worse than death for such a proud being.
