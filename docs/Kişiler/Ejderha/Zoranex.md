	Zoranex is an introverted, sinister being who thrives on psychological torment. Her favorite targets are burrowing humanoids, such as dwarves, whose elaborate tunnels she floods with toxic water. Despite her malevolence, Zoranex rarely leaves her lair, preferring the solitude of her swampy domain. Her silence is unnerving, making her ambushes all the more terrifying. Some say she speaks only to those who are about to die, ensuring her words are the last they hear.  
	  
	Her lair is an underground swamp, shrouded in darkness and heavy with the stench of decay. The lair’s maze-like tunnels are filled with traps and acidic pools.
