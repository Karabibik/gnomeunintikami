| **Karakter Betimi** | Adult<br><br>Zedralitis possesses an elegant and agile frame, long and slender compared to many of her kin. Though less robust or muscular, her body is healthy and highly adapted for speed and precision. Her large, nimble wings grant her remarkable flight control and agility, making her a master of aerial maneuvers.<br><br>Her emerald-green scales shimmer with a vibrant luster, but what truly sets her apart are the intricate jade-colored scars etched across her neck and chest. These scars, resembling the branching patterns of tree roots, were left by the thorned ivy ropes of the dryads who once controlled her. Over the centuries, the scars have taken on a haunting beauty, yet they remain a source of paranoia and a reminder of the control she once endured. |
