	Lair: A hidden forest grove with a canopy so dense sunlight barely penetrates. The air is heavy with enchantments and illusions that disorient intruders.  
	  
	Personality: As one of Clatros’ most trusted agents, Selvarith is a paragon of cunning and manipulation. She operates from the shadows, orchestrating grand schemes that unfold over centuries. Her mastery of magic is unparalleled among her kind, and she ensures that no plan is ever left to chance. Despite her influence, she leaves little evidence of her involvement, so even seasoned adventurers often fail to realize they are mere pawns in her game. Legends about her are rare, as few survive encounters with her schemes unscathed or even remember them.
