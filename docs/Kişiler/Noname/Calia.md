!!! note "Karakter Notları"  
	Ejderhalar Savaşı sırasında Sorad tarafında olan bir komutan. Dorax adında bir sentient weapon kullanıyor, o da 20 level fighter. Morguntrax'ın, insanlardan sorumlu sağ kolu.  
	  
	***Daughter of Bahamut***  
	Man cried for his sick child in despair  
	Bahamut! My Lord! Please spare  
	As her face started to turn grayer  
	Just Lord answered father’s prayer  
	Her face the platinum crown  
	She walked the land all alone  
	Kept her faith and sworn  
	To fight till evil is gone  
	Calia, they called the angel  
	Grace as she is from a fable  
	Daughter of Bahamut, why?  
	Why did you side with evil?  
	Conjures storms to protect the weak  
	During her watch foul cannot sneak  
	One day she’ll conquer Red One’s peak  
	Pilgrims walk just to see her speak  
	Wielding Justice the magic blade  
	Always rushing to poorfolk’s aid  
	Injured walk of her equals a parade  
	Taming the wicked is her trade  
	Calia the Blessed all people cheer  
	Evil whispered her name in fear  
	Daughter of Bahamut, why?  
	Why betray everything dear?  
	Sought refuge under Morgun’s dark wing  
	Foul snake she took as her king  
	Laments of all kind people now sing  
	Woe to Brohvar this news bring  
	Wears the emblem of five coloured drake  
	Swings Dorax and righteous quake  
	Kindness of any kind she forsake  
	From this cruel nightmare help us wake  
	Calia the Traitor masses curse her now  
	Just Lord’s own but to evil she bow  
	Daughter of Bahamut, why?  
	Everything in this land revered thou  
	One night you left all holy, how?
