	Zamanında, ejderhalar zamanında, [[Soradin]]'de bu isimde efsanevi bir kahraman var. [[Muzog]]'un baltasından manifest olabiliyor zaman zaman. Bronz Valgena'nın askerlerinden, hatta baltasını da bizzat o efsunlamış. Bronz ejderhalar gibi cesur ve adil olduğu için Bronz Kalpli denmiş. Muzog'un en yakın arkadaşı.  
	  
	Annallarda şöyle bahsediliyor:  
	  
	In the annals of history, amidst the tumultuous era known as "the Dragon Wars," there exists a figure shrouded in obscurity yet deserving of remembrance: Kolandir, also known as the Bronzeheart.  
	Kolandir was most likely born into a mountain tribe of dragonborns, nestled near the lair of the legendary queen of bronze dragons, Valgena the Thundering Serenity. His early life was steeped in conflict, consumed by the strife and warfare that defined the era. His first memories were of witnessing epic aerial battles between malevolent chromatic dragons and stalwart bronze dragons, who valiantly defended their village. These sights ignited a flame within him, a burning desire for combat that would define his existence.  
	From a tender age, Kolandir displayed a natural talent for warfare, moving with fluidity and precision, his instincts honed by the harsh realities of a world torn apart by war. Despite his prowess on the battlefield, Kolandir struggled in social interactions, often speaking in a peculiar manner and not understanding the social world around him. However, this never deterred him. He found solace in the simplicity of combat, where actions spoke louder than words.  
	Kolandir possessed a brilliant yet odd mind, caring little for the intricacies of social life. As the years passed, his reputation as a warrior of unmatched skill grew. He continually strove to improve, believing in Valgena and seeing himself as a simple tool in her arsenal, believing he was not important. Around that time he was given the nickname ‘the Bronzeheart’ by Valgena, to emphesize the fact that he embodied every single importat virtue of brozne dragons : determination, honor, justice and bravery. Even after Valgena herself praised him, he never truly realized he was a hero; he simply kept doing his job. His focus was always on his duty and his comrades, rather than on personal glory or fame.  
	Kolandir's leadership style was as unique as he was. Unlike leaders of our time, he eschewed grand speeches and lofty proclamations, instead leading by example, always at the forefront of battle, where his keen analytical mind could assess the situation and devise strategies to secure victory. His small army, known as the Bronzeheart Battalion, reflected his character - gruff, brazen, yet fiercely loyal. History suggests Kolandir took his battalion against chromatic dragons every time a change presented itself, often achieving surprising victories. Legend has it that Kolandir and his vanguard of heroes managed to slay multiple ancient dragons during their campaigns.  
	Near the end of the Dragon Wars, Kolandir faced his greatest challenge yet - the king of red dragons, Sorad. Despite being outnumbered and outmatched, his battalion fought fiercely. In the end, however, like so many other great heroes, they were all destroyed by the overwhelming might of the red king.  
	Although mostly forgotten to the general public, for keen students of history, Kolandir's legacy endures to this day, a testament to his indomitable spirit and unmatched skill in battle. He died as he lived, with his axe in hand and his heart full of determination, a true hero whose legend serves as a reminder of the valor and sacrifice of ages long past.
