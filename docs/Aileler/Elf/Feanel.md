The least organized and connected of the elven clans is Clan Feanel. When the six clans were being reformed, they were residing in the deeper regions of the Great Forest, occasionally assisting their elven brethren by sending warriors or supplies. While they did not reject the idea of a six-clanned elven society, after its foundation, they also did not change their way of life in the slightest.  
  
Members of Clan Feanel are, to put it simply, cut off from life outside the Great Forest. They are indifferent to wars between humans, major historical events, or natural disasters. Their way of life is alien even to Clan Ekrana, their closest relatives.  
  
The clan does not live as a society but roams the forest as small families. They are more connected to nature than any other elven clan, living in harmony with the forest.  
  
Once every 'forest year' (an arbitrary measure of time roughly translating to 15 years), clan members come together in a predetermined area in the forest for a few weeks. During this grand gathering, they catch up with each other, celebrate, and exchange members between families while their leader meets with representatives from other clans.  
  
Their leader (called Matriarch by other elven clans) is an ancient druid known as 'The Many of One.' She is a cryptic figure, seemingly no different from her brethren but rumoured to be a holder of ancient secrets and immense power. It is unknown if she has a more 'real name.' Since she probably never ventured outside the Great Forest, knowledge about this important figure is very scarce.
