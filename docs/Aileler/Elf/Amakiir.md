Among the Elven clans, this particular group stands out as the most unconventional in several aspects. They refrain from openly acknowledging their allegiance to each other or vocalizing their clan name. Although not a secret, they reserve the use of their clan name for specific inquiries. This, and many other practices, make this clan an enigma among their counterparts.  
  
This group of elves represent the organized remnants of Wood Elves who once thrived in numerous forests across the continent, outside the Great Forest. The empire's onslaught against elves hit them hardest, resulting in the destruction of their ancestral forests and the loss of most of their warriors. As a result, The Unmentioned Clan harbors a deep-seated animosity towards humans, and all of their actions are driven by an innate instinct to preserve elvenkind. Felsefelerini falan da inceliyorlar insanların. Halk seviyesinde içselleştiriyorlar İmparatorluk köylüsü ne düşünür, ortalama bir askeri ne kadar talim yapar, ne onlar için kutsaldır, neyi kafaya takmazlar şeklinde. Bir daha köşeye sıkışmamaya çok kararlılar.  
  
Their culture is distinctive. While generally amicable and even friendly towards humans as individuals, the members of this clan adopt a guarded and sometimes aggressive stance when in the company of their own. They place high value on individualism, with each member expected to master survival skills and a trade, whether martial or social. In stark contrast to their individualist approach to daily life, they demonstrate unwavering loyalty to each other when one of their own is threatened, never abandoning anyone even in the most dire circumstances.  
  
Typically residing within Thaylis settlements, this clan boasts another unusual characteristic—almost half of its members are consistently engaged in educational journeys at any given time. These journeys, lasting for extended periods (sometimes decades), take them outside the forest, where they glean knowledge from various races, including humans. Whether it's warfare or alchemy, each member is tasked with bringing back valuable insights to the forest about their chosen field. This practice is integral to their lifestyle, deemed crucial for their perpetual state of preparation against potential hostilities from the empire. Paradoxically, despite harbouring the strongest disdain for humans among elves, this clan's unique practice makes them the most frequently encountered old elves in human lands.  
  
Due to their distinct way of life, members of this clan are highly sought-after experts in broader elven society and are respected contributors to daily life. While indistinguishable from other elven settlement members to the untrained eye, they remain consistently organized and prepared.  
  
The leadership of this clan remains shrouded in mystery, even to other elves. Whispers of a millennia-old 'Forgotten Matriarch' circulate occasionally, but if such a figure exists, only high-ranking members of the clan are privy to her presence.
