A clan of wizards and intellectuals, Clan Erawan boasts an oddly high ratio of scholars amongst its people. Formed by magically gifted high elves of the Empire after their escape from the Empire following a century of mistreatment, Clan Erawan followed Clan Thaylis into the Great Forest.  
  
Most members of the clan live alongside Clan Thaylis in their settlement in the Great Forest. They function as the intellectual elite of the broader elven society and nurture a culture of academic life amongst their ranks.  
  
Their current patriarch, Verronal, is one of the most accomplished wizards born to their clan and is a respected figure in elven community. He leads his clan by providing an example of their ideals, like his father before him. While easily dwarfed in magical prowess by his uncle Delador, Verronal has a trait his uncle never had: care for his clan above all else.
