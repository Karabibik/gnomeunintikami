Among the old elven clans, Clan Thaylis easily stands as the most populous, uniquely composed of both Wood Elves and High Elves. Originating from a group of clanless and desperate elves during the turbulent era of the elven genocide in the Empire, Clan Thaylis arose from a shared understanding of the importance of cooperation amidst pain and suffering. Although their tumultuous past is not entirely forgotten, they actively embody their principles by bridging the gaps between different races.  
  
The majority of Clan Thalis resides in their distinctive city nestled within the heart of the [[Great Forest]], aptly named 'Home' in their native tongue. Established after their exodus from imperial soil and the reclamation of ancestral elven lands, 'Home' stands as a testament to the fusion of magic and architectural brilliance. The city showcases a harmonious blend of tall stone towers and wooden abodes magically shaped from living trees, crafted with meticulous craftsmanship and magical prowess, symbolizing the coexistence of elven ingenuity and the forest's organic beauty. As the largest settlement in the Great Forest, 'Home' serves as a thriving center for the Thaylis clan, embodying both the essence of their deep connection to their elven heritage and imperial past.  
  
Renowned as the most accepting clan among old elves, Clan Thaylis loosely leads the broader elven community by facilitating communication between other clans and the world beyond their forests.  
  
Clan Thaylis has a sizable presence in the city of Forgunntal. In their conclave within the city, they have embraced an unconventional practice for the past 150 years—accepting common elves into their clan. This unheard-of practice has recently resulted in the emergence of so-called 'New Elves,' children born to these common elves under the wing of Clan Thaylis. These 'New Elves' exhibit the sleepless nature of old elves and display signs of being the reincarnations of elven souls, bringing both joy and curiosity to the broader elven community.  
  
Their current Patriarch Yessen, in his advanced age, almost never leaves his beloved city but daily accepts representatives from other elven clans. He is a beloved figure who has led his people in a time of rebuilding and re-emerging as a culture.  
  
While their city in the Great Forest houses many talented and prominent elves, some of Clan Thaylis's most influential members, such as Archwizard of Federation Elowen, and Ambassador Taria, reside outside the boundaries of the Great Forest.
