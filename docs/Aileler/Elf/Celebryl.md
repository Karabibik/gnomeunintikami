Clan Celebryl is the most ancient among all old elven clans, so ancient that no one has information about the birth of the clan. They reside in their exclave in the imperial city of [[Mündung]], persistently holding onto the ancestral homeland of High Elves after more than a thousand years of hostility from humans.  
  
The clan is defined by its undying loyalty to their Queen Tinrel, the aptly named Storm Forger. A sorcerer queen of unparalleled destructive power, Tinrel displays a cold and threatening face to the outside world, including other elven clans. Yet, the eternal queen is, in fact, a shrewd diplomat and flexible leader who has left her subtle mark on the history of the continent. With a unique ability to retain her past memories clearly after each death and reincarnation, Tinrel has led her people through the most tumultuous times in known history. Thanks to her uncompromising persistence and adept diplomatic moves, Clan Celebryl survived events like the [[Ejderhalar Savaşı|War of Dragons]] and the Elven genocide. Her people understand the importance of their queen, following her every word as if it were law, trusting in her millennia-old experience.  
  
Although not numerous in population, Clan Celebryl resides in six towers in the city of Mündung as a close-knit society. Their six towers are a homage to the ancient six clans of elves. In each tower, they educate their young in the unique ways of their clan while maintaining communication with other clans and the empire.
