A clan of forest warriors, Clan Ekrana was founded by wood elves living on the border with the empire. Out of necessity, these elves needed to organize and put out a collective resistance against the threat of humans. After the empire was finally defeated following a grueling, devastating, century-long struggle that scarred the bodies and minds of most elves, the idea of forming a united elven society seemed natural to these seasoned forest warriors.  
  
Clan Ekrana has a highly militarized culture and serves as the main defensive force of the forest. They have an adaptable yet disciplined way of life, prioritizing teaching their young how to fight and survive, with everything else considered secondary.  
  
If their clan members have permanent abodes, those abodes are inside or in the near vicinity of Clan Thaylis settlements. However, half of their clan generally roams the Great Forest, living off the land in warbands.  
  
Their Great Ranger (patriarch) is Hagar, chosen among the leaders of Ekrana warbands after the passing of the previous Great Ranger.  
  
Members of Clan Ekrana can often be seen at the edges of the [[Great Forest]], but they rarely venture outside the forest.
