A semi-formal guild of city “healers,” street druids, herbalists and fortune-tellers who have agreed on two sacred principles: a shared minimum price list ("no undercutting, we’re not barbarians") and a code of “ethical divination” that mostly means don’t promise miracles you can’t fake twice. They pool suppliers, set standard fees, and present themselves as a responsible spiritual association for anxious nobles and merchants. In practice, half the membership is flamboyantly queer, everyone knows everyone’s business, and guild meetings feel like group therapy with better jewelry.
