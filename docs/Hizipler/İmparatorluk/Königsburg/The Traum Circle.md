Dr. Moritz Traum is a foreign "mind-healer" who runs small, invitation-only evening circles in a dim incense-heavy townhouse near the nicer districts of [[Könningsburg]]. He speaks softly with the perfectly measured voice, never rushes, and somehow whole rooms fall quiet just to hear him ask, `"And when did you first start feeling this way?"` While candles flicker and faint chalk diagrams fade on the floor, people laugh, cry, confess and walk out convinced they’ve been seen all the way to the bone and a little more willing to do whatever he gently suggests next. Session by session the room grows fuller, the silences heavier, and the way they watch him has shifted from interest to something very close to worship.  
  
PS: Dr. Moritz Traum could be an undercover agent of foreign powers.
