A strictly off-book, word-of-mouth sisterhood of mistresses, escorts, dancers and *"companions"* who were tired of getting hurt in silence. They meet in rotating safe rooms, share the names and patterns of violent, manipulative or cheating clients, and quietly coordinate how to protect each other or ruin the right man when necessary. The club is ultra-secret; no men, no patrons, no managers are ever meant to know it exists.
