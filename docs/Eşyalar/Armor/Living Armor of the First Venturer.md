!!! note "Notlar"  
	At first glance, this armor appears to be a weathered fragment of bark, cracked and brittle, with tiny saplings sprouting from its surface. However, when attuned by a worthy wearer—one who respects and protects nature—it awakens. The bark expands and flourishes, growing into a suit of living armor that adapts to its wielder. The greater their wisdom, the more vibrant and resilient the armor becomes, shifting between woven vines, sturdy oak plates, or even glistening leaves reinforced with nature’s essence.  
	  
	Though not sentient, the armor possesses an instinctual will, refusing to serve those who exploit or desecrate the natural world. If attuned by an unworthy wearer, it remains lifeless, offering no protection.
