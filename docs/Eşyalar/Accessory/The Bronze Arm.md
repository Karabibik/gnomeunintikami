	Forged from the tooth of the martyred Great Wyrm Valgena, this arm is a revered relic of immense power. Master transmuter Eloven Theylis spent weeks meticulously crafting it, seamlessly melding it with Muzog’s flesh. During this time, Eloven also removed the volatile and unstable elements of Muzog’s existing runic tattoos, replacing their crude, painful etchings with elegant magical circuits that channel Valgena’s magic more efficiently while stabilizing Muzog’s body.  
	  
	This arm is a marvel of magical creation, a true masterwork of Eloven, and a testament to Muzog’s adaptability and strength, Kolandir’s resilience and indomitable spirit, and Valgena’s eternal aid to mortals—even centuries after her death. The energy of one of the greatest dragons now flows through Muzog’s muscles, subtly guiding him to protect the weak and battle tyrants.  
	  
	Due to its immense power, this arm requires attunement and occupies an attunement slot.
