	"Forged in decadence, wielded in defiance, lost to ruin."  
	  
	The Utensils of Elemental Confluence are remnants of a dark and peculiar chapter in history. Crafted not for battle but for indulgence, these artifacts once belonged to Garthal’Zeth, the Glutton Tyrant, an infernal lord whose insatiable appetite defied mortal comprehension. Scouring the planes for the rarest and most exotic meats, he assembled a collection of utensils unlike any other—each bound to an elemental plane, a grotesque display of power. Fire to sear, earth to skewer, water to cleanse, and air to refine. A devil of strange appetites, he dined upon the bizarre and the forbidden, wielding these artifacts as part of his twisted feasts.  
	  
	When the enigmatic Calidrex struck down Garthal’Zeth (for trying to eat him), these instruments of excess became the spoils of an unexpected battle. Yet, Calidrex had no use for such an eccentric set of cutlery. Rather than let them fade into obscurity, he passed them into the hands of Dakrin, a warrior of ruthless cunning whose name would become infamous across the Federation. Though intended to aid in his passage through dimensions, the utensils saw little use before fate finally caught up with him.  
	  
	Now, these relics—once symbols of indulgence and later tools of a fugitive—rest in the hands of new owners. They hold immense importance, for each one can guide planar travel to its attuned plane. Whether they remain mere curiosities or become something greater is a story yet to be written.  
	  
	The Emberfork: A two-pronged fork of obsidian-black metal, always warm to the touch, with glowing runes along the handle that shift like flickering flames.  
	  
	The Skewer of the Unyielding Stone: A massive, jagged skewer of dull, metallic stone with a deep emerald sheen, too heavy for its size.  
	  
	The Ladle of the Boundless Tides: A deep, polished silver ladle with an ever-changing surface, as if filled with liquid. The handle is made of smooth coral, and it is always slightly damp. If used to drink from a source, it purifies any non-magical filth or poison and gives the water a refreshing chill.  
	  
	The Sieve of the Tempest: A weightless sieve of silvery wire, humming faintly with an unseen breeze. When tilted, it appears to filter air itself, leaving swirling patterns of mist. When shaken through the air, it enhances the natural aroma of any nearby food for a short while.
