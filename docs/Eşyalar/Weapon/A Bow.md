	This shortbow was created by an Eoha scientist, designed to aid humanoids in survival. Crafted from synthetic materials unknown to this world, its sleek, light-gray frame is unnaturally smooth and adapts seamlessly to the wielder’s grasp, making it an intuitive and deadly weapon.  
	  
	After witnessing Philliph’s valor in the battle against Anakor, Ögram bestowed his blessing upon this bow, imbuing it with the flames of his people’s unyielding spirit.
