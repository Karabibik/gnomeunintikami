	"The fire of giants is not only destruction—it is the warmth of the hearth, the shield of those who stand together."  
	  
	Forged by King Ögram, legendary blacksmith of the fire giants, this shield was crafted to commemorate the alliance between his kin and the Vagabonds of Wabronter in their triumphant battle against the ancient dragon Anakor. Alongside his four most trusted companions, Ögram fought beside the mortal warriors, their combined might breaking the dragon’s reign of terror and reclaiming the lost halls of his ancestors.  
	  
	The shield’s surface is adorned with intricate reliefs depicting the battle—Ögram and his champions standing firm, the Vagabonds striking with courage, and Anakor’s coiling form wreathed in fire and fury. Its metal is blackened steel, tempered in volcanic heat, with veins of molten gold running through it like embers that never fade. When struck, it releases a low, rumbling hum, like the echoes of giants marching to war.  
	  
	The Shield of the Hearthguard is a relic of unity in war, a testament to the bond between Ögram’s fire giants and the Vagabonds of Wabronter. It carries the weight of giantkind’s oath to protect their allies, and the memory of a battle where fire and steel stood side by side against the wrath of an ancient dragon.
